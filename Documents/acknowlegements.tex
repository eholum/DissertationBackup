I would first like to thank my dissertation supervisor, Dr. Alan Lauder, for his tremendous support and generous giving of time. I would also like to acknowledge my advisors in the mathematical institute, Professor Michael Collins and Professor Roger Heath-Brown for their constant guidance throughout my time at Oxford. I am extremely grateful to my parents, without whom I would not have had the chance to write this paper nor study in England, and who patiently edited many drafts despite their limited mathematical knowledge. I would like to thank my friends who have supported and entertained me while I wrestled with this challenging project. Finally, I honor the University of Oxford for providing me with the extraordinary opportunity to read for this degree.
